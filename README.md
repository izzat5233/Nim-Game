# Nim game with Alpha-Beta Algorithm

- The project aims to create a Nim game application that incorporates an AI opponent using the alpha-beta algorithm.
- Nim is a two-player, strategic, mathematical game where players take turns removing objects (such as stones or
  matches) from distinct heaps or piles.
- The objective is to force your opponent to remove the last object. By implementing the AI algorithm, the AI player
  will make strategic decisions to provide a competitive gaming experience.

# Methodology

- Implement the Nim game logic, including the setup of initial heaps and the rules for removing objects.
- Ensure the game can handle multiple players and various heap configurations.
- Implement the win/lose conditions.
- Implement game with alpha-beta pruning to create an intelligent AI opponent. The AI player should evaluate different
  game states, considering possible moves and countermoves to make optimal decisions.
- Develop an interactive user interface for the Nim game. Include options for players to input their moves and visualize
  the game state. Display the current state of the game, and available heaps.
- Implement a good evaluation function
- Implement different difficulty levels for the AI opponent. Allow users to choose between easy, medium, and hard
  levels.
